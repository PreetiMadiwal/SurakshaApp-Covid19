## Short description

### What's the problem?

Difficult to track people at covid-19 risk if the symptoms are not visible or the people who have not followed govt. guidelines. 

### How can technology help?

Traces the user travel history to identify if user visited any covid-19 containment zone or any time came in contact with a person tested positive with covid-19. This status check can be used as one of the deciding factor to allow a person to enter a premisis in order to avoid covid-19 spreading. Hence one can keep the community safe

### The idea

Additional check can be added to temperature check at offices, appartment, busstop etc., - "Safety Status check"
This safety status check is based on the travel history of the person- shows Safe (green) or At risk (red) indication on his mobile
anybody can easily identify the user status (safe/at-risk). We are targeting this app to reach people who are illiterare, blind person to help them identify the risk by providing an alert voice message before entering the contaminated zone.

## Long description

Current Challenges
1. The symptoms are not always evident, we are unsure how safe is the person we are in contact(Maid/co-passenger/co-worker/any visitor)
2. People migrating from different cities not everyone following the govt   guidelines.
3. Most of the people unsure of the containment zones 

Impact
  1. This  is the major cause of the fast spread of Covid-19
  2. Maids and other workers are not allowed for work since we unsure of their travel history/ how safe are they.


## Project roadmap

![Roadmap](https://github.com/PreetiMadiwal/SurakshaApp-Covid19/blob/master/Suraksha_docsToSubmit/Road%20Map.jpg)

1.Same can be developed as a plug in and integrated to existing app like Arogya setu where we already have real time data.
2.For those who donâ€™t have a smart phone we can design a device which is affordable by everyone to show this Safety status.
3. The feature can be further extended to change the safety status check when a Covid-19 infected person is close to us.
